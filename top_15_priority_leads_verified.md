Subject: Speed up new item launches at Harken Sweets

Hi Katie,

I came across your LinkedIn and Harken Sweets' incredible story!

One thing I hear from snack brand founders: filling out 10+ onboarding 
spreadsheets for new items is exhausting.

I've built an Onboarding Form Auto-Filler that populates all forms 
from your master product data. Most brands launch new items 10x faster.

Would you be open to a quick 15-min call to explore this for Harken Sweets?

Subject: Automate KeHE data entry at Aura Bora

Hi Paul,

Congrats on the Next in Natural acquisition! Saw your LinkedIn.

Even with the transition, I'm guessing the team still deals with 
manually typing SKUs into KeHE CONNECT.

I've built automation that syncs Shopify/ERP directly to KeHE—
no more manual entry. Most brands save 5-10 hours/week.

Would you (or the current ops team) be open to a quick chat?

| **Verified** | ✅ Forbes featured, public profile |

**Personalized Email:**
```
Subject: Stop losing money to KeHE chargebacks at O2

Hi Dave,

I saw your story—starting O2 from the trunk of your car is incredible!

Now that you're in 10,000+ stores, I'm guessing KeHE chargebacks 
and deductions are silently eating into margins.

I've built an automated deduction auditor that flags questionable 
chargebacks and helps you dispute them systematically. Most brands 
recover 20-40% of disputed deductions.

Worth a quick 15-min call?

Hi Alex,

Love what you're doing bringing tepache mainstream! Read about 
your background from Juice Served Here to De La Calle.

With FSMA 204 requirements looming, lot tracking is becoming critical.

I've built a Digital Traceability Log that automates lot tracking 
and generates compliance reports instantly—removes the paper 
trail headache completely.

Would you be interested in a demo for De La Calle?

Best,

Hi Mike and Nicholas,

Read about your mission to create healthier candy—love it!

One thing that grinds down margins: manually filing KeHE 
dispute claims. Most brands skip them because it's tedious.

I've built a One-Click Dispute Automator that files disputes 
automatically. Most brands recover 20-40% of disputed amounts.

Worth a quick chat?

```

### Step 2: Email 2-3 Days After Connection
If they accept, send personalized email referencing their specific pain point.

### Step 3: Follow Up
- Day 3: "Did you get a chance to see my note?"
- Day 7: "Still interested or should I check back later?"

### Key Insight:
The **founder-direct emails** (michelle@, amy.davis@, evan@, charlie@) are your FASTEST path to a response. These people read their own email and can make decisions.
